'Fifteen-year-old\\nJo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for she\\nnever seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\\nmuch in her way.', 'She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\\ngray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\\nfunny, or thoughtful.', 'Her long, thick hair was her one beauty; but it\\nwas

shooting up into a\\nwoman, and didn't like it.\", 'Elizabeth--or Beth, as every one called\\nher--was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\\nmanner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression, which was seldom\\ndisturbed.', 'Her father called her \"Little Tranquillity,\" and the name\\nsuited her excellently; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her\\nown, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.', 'Amy,\\nthough the youngest, was a most important person,--in her own opinion at\\nleast.', 'A regular snow-maiden, with blue eyes, and

moment she felt as much\\ndisappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because\\nit was so crammed with goodies.', \"Then she remembered her Marmee's\\npromise, and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little\\ncrimson-covered book.\", 'She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful\\nold story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true\\nguide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey.', 'She woke Meg with a\\n\"Merry Christmas,\" and bade her see what was under her pillow.', 'A\\ngreen-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few\\nwords written by their Marmee, which made their one present very\\nprecious in their eyes.', 'Presently Beth and Amy woke, to rummage and find\\ntheir little books also,--one dove-colored, the other blue; and all sat\\nlooking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the\\ncoming day.', 'In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,\\nwhich unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her\\nvery tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.', '\"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to\\nthe two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \"Marmee wants us to\\nread and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once.', 'We used\\nto be faithful about it; but since father went away, and all this war\\ntrouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things.', 'You can do as you\\nplease; but _I_ shall keep my book on the table here, and read a little\\nevery morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good, and help\\nme through the day.\"', 'Then she opened her new book and began to read.', 'Jo put her arm round\\nher, and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression\\nso seldom seen on her restless face.', '\"How good Meg is!', \"Come, Amy, let's do as they do.\", 'I\\'ll help you with the\\nhard words, and they\\'ll explain things if we don\\'t understand,\"\\nwhispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters\\'\\nexample.', '\"I\\'m glad mine is blue,\" said Amy; and then the rooms were very still\\nwhile the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to\\ntouch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.', '\"Where is Marmee?\"', 'asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for\\ntheir gifts, half an hour later.', '\"Goodness only knows.', \"Some poor creeter come a-beggin', and your ma went\\nstraight off to see what was needed.\", 'There never _was_ such a woman for\\ngivin\\' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin\\',\" replied Hannah, who\\nhad lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them\\nall more as a friend than a servant.', '\"She will be back soon, I think; so fry your cakes, and have everything\\nready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a\\nbasket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.', '\"Why, where is Amy\\'s bottle of cologne?\"', 'she added, as the little flask\\ndid not appear.', '\"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on\\nit, or some such notion,\" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the\\nfirst stiffness off the new army-slippers.', '\"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don\\'t they?', 'Hannah washed and ironed\\nthem for me, and I marked them all myself,\" said Beth, looking proudly\\nat the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.', '\"Bless the child!', \"she's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.\", \"March.'\", 'How funny!\"', 'cried Jo, taking up one.', '\"Isn\\'t it right?', \"I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's\\ninitials are 'M.\", 'M.,\\' and I don\\'t want any one to use these but Marmee,\"\\nsaid Beth, looking troubled.', '\"It\\'s all right, dear, and a very pretty idea,--quite sensible, too, for\\nno one can ever mistake now.', 'It will please her very much, I know,\" said\\nMeg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.', '\"There\\'s Marmee.', 'Hide the basket, quick!\"', 'cried Jo, as a door slammed,\\nand steps sounded in the hall.', 'Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters\\nall waiting for her.', '\"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\"', 'asked Meg,\\nsurprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so\\nearly.', '\"Don\\'t laugh at me, Jo!', \"I didn't mean any one should know till the time\\ncame.\", 'I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave\\n_all_ my money to get it, and I\\'m truly trying not to be selfish any\\nmore.\"', 'As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap\\none; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget\\nherself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her \"a\\ntrump,\" while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to\\nornament the stately bottle.', '\"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about\\nbeing good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the\\nminute I was up: and I\\'m _so_ glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\"', 'Another bang of the street-door sent the basket under the sofa, and the\\ngirls to the table, eager for breakfast.', '\"Merry Christmas, Marmee!', 'Many of them!', 'Thank you for our books; we read\\nsome, and mean to every day,\" they cried, in chorus.', '\"Merry Christmas, little daughters!', \"I'm glad you began at once, and hope\\nyou will keep on.\", 'But I want to say one word before we sit down.', 'Not far\\naway from here lies a poor woman with a little new-born baby.', 'Six\\nchildren are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have\\nno fire.', 'There is nothing to eat over there; and the oldest boy came to\\ntell me they were suffering hunger and cold.', 'My girls, will you give\\nthem your breakfast as a Christmas present?\"', 'They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a\\nminute no one spoke; only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously,--\\n\\n\"I\\'m so glad you came before we began!\"', '\"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\"', 'asked\\nBeth, eagerly.', '\"_I_ shall take the cream and the muffins,\" added Amy, heroically giving\\nup the articles she most liked.', 'Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one\\nbig plate.', '\"I thought you\\'d do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied.', '\"You\\nshall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and\\nmilk for breakfast, and make it up at dinner-time.\"', 'They were soon ready, and the procession set out.', 'Fortunately it was\\nearly, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and\\nno one laughed at the queer party.', '[Illustration: The procession set out]\\n\\nA poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,\\nragged bed-clothes, a sick Marmee, wailing baby, and a group of pale,\\nhungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.', 'How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in!', '\"Ach, mein Gott!', 'it is good angels come to us!\"', 'said the poor woman,\\ncrying for joy.', '\"Funny angels in hoods and mittens,\" said Jo, and set them laughing.', 'In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work\\nthere.', 'Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the\\nbroken panes with old hats and her own cloak.', 'Mrs. March gave the Marmee\\ntea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she\\ndressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own.', 'The\\ngirls, meantime, spread the table, set the children round the fire, and\\nfed them like so many hungry birds,--laughing, talking, and trying to\\nunderstand the funny broken English.', '\"Das ist gut!\"', '\"Die Engel-kinder!\"', 'cried the poor things, as they ate,\\nand warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.', 'The girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it\\nvery agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a \"Sancho\" ever\\nsince she was born.', \"That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't\\nget any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think\\nthere were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry\\nlittle girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves\\nwith bread and milk on Christmas morning.\", '\"That\\'s loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said\\nMeg, as they set out their presents, while their Marmee was upstairs\\ncollecting clothes for the poor Hummels.', 'Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in\\nthe few little bundles; and the tall vase of red roses, white\\nchrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave\\nquite an elegant air to the table.', '\"She\\'s coming!', 'Strike up, Beth!', 'Open the door, Amy!', 'Three cheers for\\nMarmee!\"', 'cried Jo, prancing about, while Meg went to conduct Marmee to\\nthe seat of honor.', 'Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted\\nescort with great dignity.', 'Mrs. March was both surprised and touched;\\nand smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents, and read the\\nlittle notes which accompanied them.', 'The slippers went on at once, a new\\nhandkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy\\'s\\ncologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were\\npronounced a \"perfect fit.\"', 'There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the\\nsimple, loving fashion which makes these home-festivals so pleasant at\\nthe time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to\\nwork.', 'The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of\\nthe day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities.', 'Being\\nstill too young to go often to the theatre, and not rich enough to\\nafford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their\\nwits to work, and--necessity being the Marmee of invention,--made\\nwhatever they needed.', 'Very clever were some of their\\nproductions,--pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned\\nbutter-boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton,\\nglittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered\\nwith the same useful diamond-shaped bits, left in sheets when the lids\\nof tin preserve-pots were cut out.', 'The furniture was used to being\\nturned topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent\\nrevels.', \"No gentlemen were admitted; so Jo played male parts to her heart's\\ncontent, and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots\\ngiven her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor.\", \"These boots,\\nan old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some\\npicture, were Jo's chief treasures, and appeared on all occasions.\", 'The\\nsmallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors\\nto take several parts apiece; and they certainly deserved some credit\\nfor the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,\\nwhisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.', 'It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and\\nemployed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or\\nspent in less profitable society.', 'On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the\\ndress-circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a\\nmost flattering state of expectancy.', 'There was a good deal of rustling\\nand whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp-smoke, and an\\noccasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the\\nexcitement of the moment.', 'Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew\\napart, and the Operatic Tragedy began.', '\"A gloomy wood,\" according to the one play-bill, was represented by a\\nfew shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the\\ndistance.', 'This cave was made with a clothes-horse for a roof, bureaus\\nfor walls; and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot\\non it, and an old witch bending over it.', 'The stage was dark, and the\\nglow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued\\nfrom the kettle when the witch took off the cover.', 'A moment was allowed\\nfor the first thrill to subside; then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with\\na clanking sword at his side, a slouched hat, black beard, mysterious\\ncloak, and the boots.', 'After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he\\nstruck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his\\nhatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to\\nkill the one and win the other.', \"The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an\\noccasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive,\\nand the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath.\", 'Bowing with\\nthe air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern, and\\nordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding \"What ho, minion!', 'I need\\nthee!\"', '[Illustration: Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face]\\n\\nOut came Meg, with gray horse-hair hanging about her face, a red and\\nblack robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak.', 'Hugo demanded\\na potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo.', 'Hagar, in\\na fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the\\nspirit who would bring the love philter:--\\n\\n        \"Hither, hither, from thy home,\\n         Airy sprite, I bid thee come!', 'Born of roses, fed on dew,\\n         Charms and potions canst thou brew?', 'Bring me here, with elfin speed,\\n         The fragrant philter which I need;\\n         Make it sweet and swift and strong,\\n         Spirit, answer now my song!\"', '[Illustration: A little figure in cloudy white]\\n\\nA soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave\\nappeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden\\nhair, and a garland of roses on its head.', 'Waving a wand, it sang,--\\n\\n         \"Hither I come,\\n          From my airy home,\\n        Afar in the silver moon.', 'Take the magic spell,\\n          And use it well,\\n        Or its power will vanish soon!\"', \"And, dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit\\nvanished.\", 'Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,--not a\\nlovely one; for, with a bang, an ugly black imp appeared, and, having\\ncroaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo, and disappeared with a\\nmocking laugh.', 'Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his\\nboots, Hugo departed; and Hagar informed the audience that, as he had\\nkilled a few of her friends in times past, she has cursed him, and\\nintends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him.', 'Then the curtain\\nfell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits\\nof the play.', 'A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again; but when\\nit became evident what a masterpiece of stage-carpentering had been got\\nup, no one murmured at the delay.', 'It was truly superb!', 'A tower rose to\\nthe ceiling; half-way up appeared a window, with a lamp burning at it,\\nand behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver\\ndress, waiting for Roderigo.', 'He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap,\\nred cloak, chestnut love-locks, a guitar, and the boots, of course.', 'Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones.', 'Zara replied, and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly.', 'Then came\\nthe grand effect of the play.', 'Roderigo produced a rope-ladder, with five\\nsteps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend.', 'Timidly she\\ncrept from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo\\'s shoulder, and was\\nabout to leap gracefully down, when, \"Alas!', 'alas for Zara!\"', 'she forgot\\nher train,--it caught in the window; the tower tottered, leaned forward,\\nfell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins!', 'A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the\\nwreck, and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, \"I told you so!', 'I told you\\nso!\"', 'With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed\\nin, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside,--\\n\\n\"Don\\'t laugh!', 'Act as if it was all right!\"', '--and, ordering Roderigo up,\\nbanished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn.', 'Though decidedly\\nshaken by the fall of the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old\\ngentleman, and refused to stir.', 'This dauntless example fired Zara: she\\nalso defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons\\nof the castle.', 'A stout little retainer came in with chains, and led them\\naway, looking very much frightened, and evidently forgetting the speech\\nhe ought to have made.', 'Act third was the castle hall; and here Hagar appeared, having come to\\nfree the lovers and finish Hugo.', 'She hears him coming, and hides; sees\\nhim put the potions into two cups of wine, and bid the timid little\\nservant \"Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall\\ncome anon.\"', 'The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something, and\\nHagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless.', 'Ferdinando,\\nthe \"minion,\" carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds\\nthe poison meant for Roderigo.', 'Hugo, getting thirsty after a long\\nwarble, drinks it, loses his wits, and, after a good deal of clutching\\nand stamping, falls flat and dies; while Hagar informs him what she has\\ndone in a song of exquisite power and melody.', \"This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought\\nthat the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long hair rather marred\\nthe effect of the villain's death.\", 'He was called before the curtain, and\\nwith great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was\\nconsidered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put\\ntogether.', 'Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing\\nhimself, because he has been told that Zara has deserted him.', 'Just as\\nthe dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window,\\ninforming him that Zara is true, but in danger, and he can save her, if\\nhe will.', 'A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of\\nrapture he tears off his chains, and rushes away to find and rescue his\\nlady-love.', 'Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro.', \"He\\nwishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it; and, after a\\ntouching appeal, is about to faint, when Roderigo dashes in and demands\\nher hand.\", 'Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich.', 'They shout and\\ngesticulate tremendously, but cannot agree, and Roderigo is about to\\nbear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a\\nletter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared.', \"The\\nlatter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young\\npair, and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy.\", 'The\\nbag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the\\nstage, till it is quite glorified with the glitter.', 'This entirely\\nsoftens the \"stern sire\": he consents without a murmur, all join in a\\njoyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive\\nDon Pedro\\'s blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.', '[Illustration: The lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro\\'s blessing]\\n\\nTumultuous applause followed, but received an unexpected check; for the\\ncot-bed, on which the \"dress-circle\" was built, suddenly shut up, and\\nextinguished the enthusiastic audience.', 'Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to\\nthe rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless\\nwith laughter.', 'The excitement had hardly subsided, when Hannah appeared,\\nwith \"Mrs. March\\'s compliments, and would the ladies walk down to\\nsupper.\"', 'This was a surprise, even to the actors; and, when they saw the table,\\nthey looked at one another in rapturous amazement.', 'It was like Marmee to\\nget up a little treat for them; but anything so fine as this was\\nunheard-of since the departed days of plenty.', 'There was\\nice-cream,--actually two dishes of it, pink and white,--and cake and\\nfruit and distracting French bonbons, and, in the middle of the table,\\nfour great bouquets of hot-house flowers!', 'It quite took their breath away; and they stared first at the table and\\nthen at their Marmee, who looked as

on,\" all about their plays\\nand plans, their hopes and fears for father, and the most interesting\\nevents of the little world in which the sisters lived.', \"Then they got to\\ntalking about books; and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved\\nthem as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.\", '\"If you like them so much, come down and see ours.', 'Grandpa is out, so\\nyou needn\\'t be afraid,\" said Laurie, getting up.', '\"I\\'m not afraid of anything,\" returned Jo, with a toss of the head.', '\"I don\\'t believe you are!\"', 'exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much\\nadmiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to be\\na trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his\\nmoods.', 'The atmosphere of the whole house being summer-like, Laurie led the way\\nfrom room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy;\\nand so at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands,\\nand pranced, as she always did when especially delighted.', 'It was lined\\nwith books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little\\ncabinets full of coins and curiosities, and sleepy-hollow chairs, and\\nqueer tables, and bronzes; and, best of all, a great open fireplace,\\nwith quaint tiles all round it.', '\"What richness!\"', 'sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velvet chair,\\nand gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction.', '\"Theodore\\nLaurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,\" she added\\nimpressively.', '\"A fellow can\\'t live on books,\" said Laurie, shaking his head, as he\\nperched on a table opposite.', 'Before he could say more, a bell rung, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with\\nalarm, \"Mercy me!', 'it\\'s your grandpa!\"', '\"Well, what if it is?', 'You are not afraid of anything, you know,\"\\nreturned the boy, looking wicked.', '\"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don\\'t know why I should\\nbe.', 'Marmee said I might come, and I don\\'t think you\\'re any the worse for\\nit,\" said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the door.', '\"I\\'m a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged.', 'I\\'m only\\nafraid you are very tired talking to me; it was _so_ pleasant, I\\ncouldn\\'t bear to stop,\" said Laurie gratefully.', '\"The doctor to see you, sir,\" and the maid beckoned as she spoke.', '\"Would you mind if I left you for a minute?', 'I suppose I must see him,\"\\nsaid Laurie.', '\"Don\\'t mind me.', 'I\\'m as happy as a cricket here,\" answered Jo.', 'Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way.', 'She was\\nstanding before a fine portrait of the old gentleman, when the door\\nopened again, and, without turning, she said decidedly, \"I\\'m sure now\\nthat I shouldn\\'t be afraid of him, for he\\'s got kind eyes, though his\\nmouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own.', 'He isn\\'t as handsome as _my_ grandfather, but I like him.\"', '\"Thank you, ma\\'am,\" said a gruff voice behind her; and there, to her\\ngreat dismay, stood old Mr_Laurence.', \"Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began\\nto beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said.\", 'For a\\nminute a wild desire to run away possessed her; but that was cowardly,\\nand the girls would laugh at her: so she resolved to stay, and get out\\nof the scrape as she could.', 'A second look showed her that the living\\neyes, under the bushy gray eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted\\nones; and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a\\ngood deal.', 'The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman\\nsaid abruptly, after that dreadful pause, \"So you\\'re not afraid of me,\\nhey?\"', '\"Not much, sir.\"', '\"And you don\\'t think me as handsome as your grandfather?\"', '\"Not quite, sir.\"', '\"And I\\'ve got a tremendous will, have I?\"', '\"I only said I thought so.\"', '\"But you like me, in spite of it?\"', '\"Yes, I do, sir.\"', 'That answer pleased the old gentleman; he gave a short laugh, shook\\nhands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her\\nface, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying, with a nod, \"You\\'ve\\ngot your grandfather\\'s spirit, if you haven\\'t his face.', 'He _was_ a fine\\nman, my dear; but, what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and\\nI was proud to be his friend.\"', '[Illustration: Putting his finger under her chin]\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir;\" and Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited\\nher exactly.', '\"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?\"', 'was the next\\nquestion, sharply put.', '\"Only trying to be neighborly, sir;\" and Jo told how her visit came\\nabout.', '\"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?\"', '\"Yes, sir; he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good\\nperhaps.', 'We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could,\\nfor we don\\'t forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us,\" said Jo\\neagerly.', '\"Tut, tut, tut!', \"that was the boy's affair.\", 'How is the poor woman?\"', '\"Doing nicely, sir;\" and off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all\\nabout the Hummels, in whom her Marmee had interested richer friends than\\nthey were.', '\"Just her father\\'s way of doing good.', 'I shall come and see your Marmee\\nsome fine day.', 'Tell her so.', \"There's the tea-bell; we have it early, on\\nthe boy's account.\", 'Come down, and go on being neighborly.\"', '\"If you\\'d like to have me, sir.\"', '\"Shouldn\\'t ask you, if I didn\\'t;\" and Mr_Laurence offered her his arm\\nwith old-fashioned courtesy.', '\"What _would_ Meg say to this?\"', 'thought Jo, as she was marched away,\\nwhile her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story\\nat home.', '\"Hey!', 'Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?\"', 'said the old\\ngentleman, as Laurie came running down stairs, and brought up with a\\nstart of surprise at the astonishing sight of Jo arm-in-arm with his\\nredoubtable grandfather.', '\"I didn\\'t know you\\'d come, sir,\" he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant\\nlittle glance.', '\"That\\'s evident, by the way you racket down stairs.', 'Come to your tea,\\nsir, and behave like a gentleman;\" and having pulled the boy\\'s hair by\\nway of a caress, Mr_Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a\\nseries of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an\\nexplosion of laughter from Jo.', 'The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea, but\\nhe watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old friends, and\\nthe change in his grandson did not escape him.', \"There was color, light,\\nand life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine\\nmerriment in his laugh.\", '\"She\\'s right; the lad _is_ lonely.', 'I\\'ll see what these little girls can\\ndo for him,\" thought Mr_Laurence, as he looked and listened.', 'He liked\\nJo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him; and she seemed to understand the\\nboy almost as well as if she had been one herself.', 'If the Laurences had been what Jo called \"prim and poky,\" she would not\\nhave got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward; but\\nfinding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good\\nimpression.', 'When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had\\nsomething more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which\\nhad been lighted for her benefit.', 'It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as\\nshe went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either\\nside, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and\\ntrees that hung above her,--while her new friend cut the finest flowers\\ntill his hands were full; then he tied them up, saying, with the happy\\nlook Jo liked to see, \"Please give these to your Marmee, and tell her I\\nlike the medicine she sent me very much.\"', \"[Illustration: Please give these to your Marmee]\\n\\nThey found Mr_Laurence standing before the fire in the great\\ndrawing-room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano,\\nwhich stood open.\", '\"Do you play?\"', 'she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful\\nexpression.', '\"Sometimes,\" he answered modestly.', '\"Please do now.', 'I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.\"', '\"Won\\'t you first?\"', '\"Don\\'t know how; too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.\"', 'So Laurie played, and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in\\nheliotrope and tea-roses.', 'Her respect and regard for the \"Laurence boy\"\\nincreased very much, for he played remarkably well, and didn\\'t put on\\nany airs.', 'She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so; only\\npraised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to the\\nrescue.', '\"That will do, that will do, young lady.',

again.\", 'My respects to your Marmee.', 'Good-night, Doctor\\nJo.\"', 'He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him.', 'When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said anything\\namiss.', 'He shook his head.', '\"No, it was me; he doesn\\'t like to hear me play.\"', '\"Why not?\"', '\"I\\'ll tell you some day.', 'John is going home with you, as I can\\'t.\"', '\"No need of that; I am not a young lady, and it\\'s only a step.', 'Take care\\nof yourself, won\\'t you?\"', '\"Yes; but you will come again, I hope?\"', '\"If you promise to come and see us after

Jo,\\nwho was of an inquiring disposition.', '\"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie\\'s father,\\nmarried an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who\\nis very proud.', 'The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did\\nnot like her, and never saw his son after he married.', 'They both died\\nwhen Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home.', 'I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old\\nman is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful.', 'Laurie comes\\nnaturally by his love of music, for he is like his Marmee, and I dare\\nsay his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician; at any\\nrate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he\\n\\'glowered,\\' as Jo said.\"', '\"Dear me, how romantic!\"', 'exclaimed Meg.', '\"How silly!\"', 'said Jo.', '\"Let him be a musician, if he wants to, and not\\nplague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.\"', '\"That\\'s why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I\\nsuppose.', 'Italians are always nice,\" said Meg, who was a little\\nsentimental.', '\"What do you know about his eyes and his manners?', 'You never spoke to\\nhim, hardly,\" cried Jo, who was _not_ sentimental.', '\"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to\\nbehave.', 'That was a nice little speech about the medicine Marmee sent\\nhim.\"', '\"He meant the blanc-mange, I suppose.\"', '\"How stupid you are, child!', 'He meant you, of course.\"', '\"Did he?\"', 'and Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her\\nbefore.', '\"I never saw such a girl!', 'You don\\'t know a compliment when you get it,\"\\nsaid Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter.',

the girls, and talked over old times with\\ntheir Marmee, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth.', 'The\\nother lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich; for this\\nmade them shy of accepting favors which they could not return.', \"But,\\nafter a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and\\ncould not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's\\nMarmeely welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in\\nthat humble home of theirs.\", 'So they soon forgot their pride, and\\ninterchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.', 'All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time; for the new\\nfriendship flourished like grass in spring.', 'Every one liked Laurie, and\\nhe privately informed his tutor that \"the Marches were regularly\\nsplendid girls.\"', 'With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the\\nsolitary boy into their midst, and made much of him, and he found\\nsomething very charming in the innocent companionship of these\\nsimple-hearted girls.', 'Never having known Marmee or sisters, he was quick\\nto feel the influences they brought about him;

reports; for Laurie was always playing\\ntruant, and running over to the Marches.', '\"Never mind; let him take a holiday, and make it up afterwards,\" said\\nthe old gentleman.', '\"The good lady

had, to be sure!', 'Such plays and tableaux, such\\nsleigh-rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old\\nparlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house.', 'Meg\\ncould walk in the conservatory whenever she liked, and revel in\\nbouquets; Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the\\nold gentleman with her criticisms; Amy copied pictures, and enjoyed\\nbeauty to her heart\\'s content; and Laurie played \"lord of the manor\" in\\nthe most delightful style.', 'But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up\\ncourage to go to the \"Mansion of Bliss,\" as Meg called it.', 'She went once\\nwith Jo; but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared\\nat her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said \"Hey!\"', 'so loud,\\nthat he frightened her so much her \"feet chattered on the floor,\" she\\ntold her Marmee; and she ran away, declaring she would never go there\\nany more, not even for the dear piano.', \"No persuasions or enticements\\ncould overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr_Laurence's ear in\\nsome mysterious way, he set about mending matters.\", 'During one of the\\nbrief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and\\ntalked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had\\nheard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to\\nstay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if\\nfascinated.', 'At the back of his chair she stopped, and stood listening,\\nwith her great eyes wide open, and her cheeks red with the excitement of\\nthis unusual performance.', 'Taking no more notice of her than if she had\\nbeen a fly, Mr_Laurence talked on about Laurie\\'s lessons and teachers;\\nand presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs.\\nMarch,--\\n\\n\"The boy neglects his music now, and I\\'m glad of it, for he was getting\\ntoo fond of it.', 'But the piano suffers for want of use.', 'Wouldn\\'t some of\\nyour girls like to run over, and practise on it now and then, just to\\nkeep it in tune, you know, ma\\'am?\"', 'Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep\\nfrom clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation; and the\\nthought of practising on that splendid instrument quite took her breath\\naway.', 'Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr_Laurence went on with an odd\\nlittle nod and smile,--\\n\\n\"They needn\\'t see or speak to any one, but run in at any time; for I\\'m\\nshut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great\\ndeal, and the servants are never near the drawing-room after nine\\no\\'clock.\"', 'Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that\\nlast arrangement left nothing to be desired.', '\"Please tell the young\\nladies what I say; and if they don\\'t care to come, why, never mind.\"', 'Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a\\nface full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way,--\\n\\n\"O sir, they do care, very, very much!\"', '[Illustration: O sir, they do care very much]\\n\\n\"Are you the musical girl?\"', 'he asked, without any startling \"Hey!\"', 'as he\\nlooked down at her very kindly.', '\"I\\'m Beth.', 'I love it dearly, and I\\'ll come, if you are

come, and drum\\naway as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.\"', '\"How kind you are, sir!\"', 'Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore; but she was\\nnot frightened now, and gave the big hand a grateful squeeze, because\\nshe had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her.', 'The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and,\\nstooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard,--\\n\\n\"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.', 'God bless you, my dear!', 'Good day, madam;\" and away he went, in a great hurry.', 'Beth had a rapture with her Marmee, and then rushed up to impart the\\nglorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not at home.', 'How blithely she sung that evening, and how they all laughed at her,\\nbecause she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in\\nher sleep.', 'Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of\\nthe house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the\\nside-door, and made her way, as noiselessly as any mouse, to the\\ndrawing-room, where her idol stood.', 'Quite by accident, of course, some\\npretty, easy music lay on the piano; and, with trembling fingers, and\\nfrequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great\\ninstrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything\\nelse but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was\\nlike the voice of a beloved friend.', 'She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner; but she had no\\nappetite, and could only sit and smile upon every one in a general state\\nof beatitude.', 'After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every\\nday, and the great drawing-room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that\\ncame and went unseen.', 'She never knew that Mr_Laurence often opened his\\nstudy-door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked; she never saw Laurie\\nmount guard in the hall to warn the servants away; she never suspected\\nthat the exercise-books and new songs which she found in the rack were\\nput there for her especial benefit; and when he talked to her about\\nmusic at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that\\nhelped her so much.', \"So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what\\nisn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped.\", 'Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a\\ngreater was given her; at any rate, she deserved both.', '[Illustration: Mr_Laurence

for the making\\nup,\" replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth\\'s\\nrequests, because she so seldom asked anything for herself.', 'After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen,\\nthe materials bought, and the slippers begun.', 'A cluster of grave yet\\ncheerful pansies, on a deeper purple ground, was pronounced very\\nappropriate and pretty; and Beth worked away early and late, with\\noccasional lifts over hard parts.', 'She was a nimble little needle-woman,\\nand they were finished before any one got tired of them.', \"Then she wrote\\na very short, simple note, and, with Laurie's help, got them smuggled on\\nto the study-table one morning before the old gentleman was up.\", 'When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen.', 'All\\nthat day passed, and a part of the next, before any acknowledgment\\narrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety\\nfriend.', 'On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an\\nerrand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise.', 'As\\nshe came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four, heads\\npopping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her,\\nseveral hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed,--\\n\\n\"Here\\'s a letter from the old gentleman!', 'Come quick, and read it!\"', '\"O Beth, he\\'s sent you--\" began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy;\\nbut she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.', 'Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense.', 'At the door, her sisters\\nseized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all\\npointing, and all saying at once, \"Look there!', 'look there!\"', 'Beth did\\nlook, and turned pale with delight and surprise; for there stood a\\nlittle cabinet-piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed,\\nlike a sign-board, to \"Miss Elizabeth March.\"', '\"For me?\"', 'gasped Beth, holding on to Jo, and feeling as if she should\\ntumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.', '\"Yes; all for you, my precious!', \"Isn't it splendid of him?\", \"Don't you\\nthink he's the dearest old man in the world?\", \"Here's the key in the\\nletter.\", 'We didn\\'t open it, but we are dying to know what he says,\" cried\\nJo, hugging her sister, and offering the note.', '\"You read it!', \"I can't, I feel so queer!\", 'Oh, it is too lovely!\"', \"and Beth\\nhid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.\", 'Jo opened the paper, and began to laugh, for the first words she saw\\nwere,--\\n\\n    \"MISS MARCH:\\n\\n        \"_Dear Madam_,--\"\\n\\n\"How nice it sounds!', 'I wish some one would write to me so!\"', 'said Amy,\\nwho thought

things carefully.', \"Just think, he's given you her piano.\", 'That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,\" said Jo, trying to\\nsoothe Beth, who trembled, and looked more excited than she had ever\\nbeen before.', '\"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk,\\npuckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and\\nstool, all complete,\" added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying\\nits beauties.', '\"\\'Your humble servant, James Laurence\\'; only think of his writing that\\nto you.', \"I'll tell the girls.\", 'They\\'ll think it\\'s splendid,\" said Amy,\\nmuch impressed by the note.', '\"Try it, honey.', 'Let\\'s hear the sound of the baby-pianny,\" said Hannah,\\nwho always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.', 'So Beth tried it; and every one pronounced it the most remarkable piano\\never heard.', 'It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie\\norder; but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm of it lay in the\\nhappiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly\\ntouched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright\\npedals.', '\"You\\'ll have to go and thank him,\" said Jo, by way of a joke; for the\\nidea of the child\\'s really going never entered her head.', '\"Yes, I mean to.', 'I guess I\\'ll go now, before I get frightened thinking\\nabout it.\"', \"And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth\\nwalked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the\\nLaurences' door.\", '\"Well, I wish I may die if it ain\\'t the queerest thing I ever see!', 'The\\npianny has turned her head!', 'She\\'d never have gone in her right mind,\"\\ncried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite\\nspeechless by the miracle.', 'They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did\\nafterward.', 'If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the\\nstudy-door before she gave herself time to think; and when a gruff voice\\ncalled out, \"Come in!\"', 'she did go in, right up to Mr_Laurence, who\\nlooked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a\\nsmall quaver in her voice, \"I came to thank you, sir, for--\" But she\\ndidn\\'t finish; for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech,\\nand, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put\\nboth arms round his neck, and kissed him.', \"[Illustration: She put both arms around his neck and kissed him]\\n\\nIf the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman\\nwouldn't have been more astonished; but he liked it,--oh, dear, yes, he\\nliked it amazingly!--and was so touched and pleased by that confiding\\nlittle kiss that all his crustiness vanished; and he just set her on his\\nknee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he\\nhad got his own little granddaughter back again.\", 'Beth ceased to fear him\\nfrom that moment, and sat there talking to him as cosily as if she had\\nknown him all her life; for love casts out fear, and gratitude can\\nconquer pride.', 'When she went home, he walked with her to her own gate,\\nshook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again,\\nlooking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old\\ngentleman, as he was.', 'When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to

about \"some persons whose noses were not too flat to\\nsmell other people\\'s limes, and stuck-up people, who were not too proud\\nto ask for them;\" and she instantly crushed \"that Snow girl\\'s\"

goes before a\\nfall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success.', 'No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments, and bowed\\nhimself out, than Jenny, under pretence of asking an important question,\\ninformed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her\\ndesk.', 'Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly\\nvowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the\\nlaw.', 'This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing-gum after\\na long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and\\nnewspapers, had suppressed a private post-office, had forbidden\\ndistortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that\\none man could do to

the\\nexpressive, if not elegant, language of a school-girl, \"he was as\\nnervous as a witch and as cross as a bear.\"', 'The word \"limes\" was like\\nfire to powder; his yellow face flushed, and he

blue, black,\\ngray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.', '\"Miss March, come to the desk.\"', 'Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed\\nher, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.', '\"Bring with you the limes you have in your desk,\" was the unexpected\\ncommand which arrested her before she got out of her seat.', '\"Don\\'t take all,\" whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great presence\\nof mind.', 'Amy hastily shook out half a dozen, and laid the rest down before Mr.\\nDavis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when\\nthat delicious perfume met his nose.', 'Unfortunately, Mr. Davis\\nparticularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust\\nadded to his wrath.', '\"Is that all?\"', '\"Not quite,\" stammered Amy.', '\"Bring the rest immediately.\"', 'With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.', '\"You are sure there are no more?\"', '\"I never lie, sir.\"', '\"So I see.', 'Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them\\nout of the window.\"', 'There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as the\\nlast hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips.', 'Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times;\\nand as each doomed couple--looking oh!', 'so plump and juicy--fell from her\\nreluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of the\\ngirls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the\\nlittle Irish children, who were their sworn foes.', 'This--this was too\\nmuch; all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable\\nDavis, and one passionate lime-lover burst into tears.', 'As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous \"Hem!\"', 'and said, in his most impressive manner,--\\n\\n\"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago.', 'I am sorry\\nthis has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I\\n_never_ break my word.', 'Miss March, hold out your hand.\"', 'Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring\\nlook which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter.', 'She was rather a favorite with \"old Davis,\" as, of course, he was\\ncalled, and it\\'s my private belief that he _would_ have broken his word\\nif the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in\\na hiss.', \"That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible gentleman,\\nand sealed the culprit's fate.\", '\"Your hand, Miss March!\"', 'was the only answer her mute appeal received;\\nand, too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her\\nhead defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her\\nlittle palm.', 'They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no\\ndifference to her.', 'For the first time in her life she had been struck;\\nand the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her\\ndown.', '[Illustration: Amy bore without flinching several tingling blows]\\n\\n\"You will now stand on the platform till recess,\" said Mr. Davis,\\nresolved to do the thing

face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her,\\nseemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop\\ndown where she stood, and break her heart with crying.', 'A bitter sense of\\nwrong, and the thought of Jenny Snow, helped her to bear it; and, taking\\nthe ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove-funnel above what\\nnow seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that\\nthe girls found it very hard to study, with that pathetic figure before\\nthem.', 'During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little\\ngirl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot.', 'To others it\\nmight seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a hard\\nexperience; for during the twelve years of her life she had been\\ngoverned by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her\\nbefore.', 'The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten\\nin the sting of the thought,--\\n\\n\"I shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me!\"', 'The fifteen minutes seemed an hour; but they came to an end at last, and\\nthe word \"Recess!\"', 'had never seemed so welcome to her before.', '\"You can go, Miss March,\" said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,\\nuncomfortable.', 'He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she went,\\nwithout a word to any one, straight into the ante-room, snatched her\\nthings, and left the place \"forever,\" as she passionately declared to\\nherself.', 'She was in a sad state when she got home; and when the older\\ngirls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held at\\nonce.', 'Mrs. March did not say much, but looked disturbed, and comforted\\nher afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner.', 'Meg bathed the\\ninsulted hand with glycerine and tears; Beth felt that even her beloved\\nkittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this; Jo wrathfully\\nproposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay; and Hannah shook her\\nfist at the \"villain,\" and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him\\nunder her pestle.', \"No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates; but

stalked up to the desk, and\\ndelivered a letter from her Marmee; then collected Amy's property, and\\ndeparted, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door-mat, as\\nif she shook the dust of the place off her feet.\", '\"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a\\nlittle every day, with Beth,\" said Mrs. March, that evening.', '\"I don\\'t\\napprove of

sighed\\nAmy, with the air of a martyr.', '\"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved\\nsome punishment for disobedience,\" was the severe reply, which rather\\ndisappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.', '\"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school?\"', 'cried Amy.', '\"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,\" replied her\\nMarmee; \"but I\\'m not sure that it won\\'t do you more good than a milder\\nmethod.', 'You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is quite\\ntime you set about correcting it.', 'You have a good many little gifts and\\nvirtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the\\nfinest genius.', 'There is not much danger that real talent or goodness\\nwill be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing\\nand using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power\\nis modesty.\"', '\"So it is!\"', 'cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo.', '\"I\\nknew a girl, once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she\\ndidn\\'t know it; never guessed what sweet little things she composed when\\nshe was alone, and wouldn\\'t have believed it if any one had told her.\"', '\"I wish I\\'d known that nice girl; maybe she would have helped me, I\\'m so\\nstupid,\" said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.', '\"You do know her, and she helps you better than any one else could,\"\\nanswered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his\\nmerry black eyes, that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face\\nin the sofa-cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.', '[Illustration: You do know her]\\n\\nJo let Laurie win the game, to pay for that praise of her Beth, who\\ncould not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment.', 'So\\nLaurie did his best, and sung delightfully, being in a particularly\\nlively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his\\ncharacter.', 'When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all the evening,\\nsaid suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,--\\n\\n\"Is Laurie an accomplished boy?\"', '\"Yes; he has had an excellent education, and has much talent; he will\\nmake a fine man, if not spoilt by petting,\" replied her Marmee.', '\"And he isn\\'t conceited, is he?\"', 'asked Amy.', '\"Not in the least; that is why he is so charming, and we all like him so\\nmuch.\"', '\"I see; it\\'s nice to have accomplishments, and be elegant; but not to\\nshow off, or get perked up,\" said Amy thoughtfully.', '\"These things are always seen and felt in a person\\'s manner and\\nconversation, if modestly used; but it is not necessary to display\\nthem,\" said Mrs. March.', '\"Any more than it\\'s proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and\\nribbons at once, that folks may know you\\'ve got them,\" added Jo; and the\\nlecture ended in a laugh.', '[Illustration: Girls, where are you going?]', 'VIII.', 'JO MEETS APOLLYON.', '\"Girls, where are you going?\"', 'asked Amy, coming into their room one\\nSaturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out, with an\\nair of secrecy which excited her curiosity.', '\"Never mind; little girls shouldn\\'t ask questions,\" returned Jo sharply.', 'Now if there _is_ anything mortifying to our feelings, when we are\\nyoung, it is to be told that; and to be bidden to \"run away, dear,\" is\\nstill more trying to us.', 'Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined\\nto find out the secret, if she teased for an hour.', 'Turning to Meg, who\\nnever refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, \"Do tell me!', 'I\\nshould think you might let me go, too; for Beth is fussing over her\\npiano, and I haven\\'t got anything to do, and am _so_ lonely.\"', '\"I can\\'t, dear, because you aren\\'t invited,\" began Meg; but Jo broke in\\nimpatiently, \"Now, Meg, be quiet, or you will

as going with you and Laurie.', \"Please let\\nme; I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I'm dying for\\nsome fun.\", 'Do, Meg!', 'I\\'ll be ever so good,\" pleaded Amy, looking as\\npathetic as she could.', '\"Suppose we take her.', 'I don\\'t believe Marmee would mind, if we bundle\\nher up well,\" began Meg.', '\"If _she_ goes _I_ sha\\'n\\'t; and if I don\\'t, Laurie won\\'t like it; and it\\nwill be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy.', 'I\\nshould think she\\'d hate to poke herself where she isn\\'t wanted,\" said Jo\\ncrossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child,\\nwhen she wanted to enjoy herself.', 'Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,\\nin her most aggravating way, \"I

do to make her\\n\"sorry for it.\"', 'She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course\\nof their lives, for both had quick tempers, and were apt to be violent\\nwhen fairly roused.', 'Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and\\nsemi-occasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed\\nafterward.', 'Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had\\nhard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting\\nher into trouble; her anger never lasted long, and, having humbly\\nconfessed her fault, she sincerely repented, and tried to do better.', 'Her\\nsisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury,\\nbecause she was such an angel afterward.', 'Poor Jo tried desperately to be\\ngood, but her bosom enemy was always

voice was gone;\\nshe tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in\\nthem; and, for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring, with\\na terror-stricken face, at the little blue hood above the black water.', 'Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie\\'s voice cried out,--\\n\\n\"Bring a rail; quick, quick!\"', 'How she did it, she never knew; but for the next few minutes she worked\\nas if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed,\\nand, lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey till Jo dragged a\\nrail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more\\nfrightened than hurt.', '[Illustration: Held Amy up by his arms and hockey]\\n\\n\"Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can; pile our things on\\nher, while I get off these confounded skates,\" cried Laurie, wrapping\\nhis coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps, which never seemed\\nso intricate before.', 'Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home; and, after an\\nexciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets, before a hot\\nfire.', 'During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken; but flown about, looking\\npale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands\\ncut and bruised by ice and rails, and refractory buckles.', 'When Amy was\\ncomfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed,\\nshe called Jo to her, and began to bind up the hurt hands.', '\"Are you sure she is safe?\"', 'whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the\\ngolden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever\\nunder the treacherous ice.', '\"Quite safe, dear; she is not hurt, and won\\'t even take cold, I think,\\nyou were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly,\" replied\\nher Marmee cheerfully.', '\"Laurie did it all; I only let her go.', 'Mother, if she _should_ die, it\\nwould be my fault\"; and Jo dropped down beside the bed, in a passion of\\npenitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her\\nhardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the\\nheavy punishment which might have come upon her.', '\"It\\'s my dreadful temper!', 'I try to cure it; I think I have, and then it\\nbreaks out worse than ever.', 'O Marmee, what shall I do?', 'what shall I do?\"', 'cried poor Jo, in despair.', '\"Watch and pray, dear; never get tired of trying; and never think it is\\nimpossible to conquer your fault,\" said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy\\nhead to her shoulder, and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo\\ncried harder than ever.', '\"You don\\'t know, you can\\'t guess how bad it is!', \"It seems as if I could\\ndo anything when I'm in a passion; I get so savage, I could hurt any\\none, and enjoy it.\", \"I'm afraid I _shall_ do something dreadful some day,\\nand spoil my life, and make everybody hate me.\", 'O Marmee, help me, do\\nhelp me!\"', '\"I will, my child, I will.', \"Don't cry so bitterly, but remember this day,\\nand resolve, with all your soul, that you will never know another like\\nit.\", 'Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than yours,\\nand it often takes us all our lives to conquer them.', 'You think your\\ntemper is the worst in the world; but mine used to be just like it.\"', '\"Yours, Marmee?', 'Why, you are never angry!\"', 'and, for the moment, Jo\\nforgot remorse in surprise.', '\"I\\'ve been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded in\\ncontrolling it.', 'I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo; but I have\\nlearned not to show it; and I still hope to learn not to feel it, though\\nit may take me another forty years to do so.\"', 'The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better\\nlesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof.', 'She felt\\ncomforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her; the\\nknowledge that her Marmee had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it,\\nmade her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it;\\nthough forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray, to a\\ngirl of fifteen.', '\"Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together, and go\\nout of the room sometimes, when Aunt_March scolds, or people worry\\nyou?\"', 'asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her Marmee than ever\\nbefore.', '\"Yes, I\\'ve learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips; and\\nwhen I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away\\na minute, and give myself a little shake, for being so weak and wicked,\"\\nanswered Mrs. March, with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed and\\nfastened up Jo\\'s dishevelled hair.', '\"How did you learn to keep still?', \"That is what troubles me--for the\\nsharp words fly out before I know what I'm about; and the more I say the\\nworse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's feelings, and say\\ndreadful things.\", 'Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.\"', '\"My good Marmee used to help me--\"\\n\\n\"As you do us--\" interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.', '\"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years\\nhad to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to\\nany one else.', 'I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears\\nover my failures; for, in spite of my efforts, I never seemed to get on.', 'Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be\\ngood.', 'But by and by, when I had four little daughters round me, and we\\nwere poor, then the old trouble began again; for I am not patient by\\nnature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.\"', '\"Poor Marmee!', 'what helped you then?\"', '\"Your father, Jo.', 'He never loses patience,--never doubts or\\ncomplains,--but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully, that\\none is ashamed to do otherwise before him.', 'He helped and comforted me,\\nand showed me that I must try to practise all the virtues I would have\\nmy little girls possess, for I was their example.', 'It was easier to try\\nfor your sakes than for my own; a startled or surprised look from one of\\nyou, when I spoke sharply, rebuked me more than any words could have\\ndone; and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the\\nsweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would\\nhave them copy.\"', '\"O Marmee, if I\\'m ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied,\" cried\\nJo, much touched.', '\"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear; but you must keep watch\\nover your \\'bosom enemy,\\' as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not\\nspoil your life.', 'You have had a warning; remember it, and try with heart\\nand soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you greater\\nsorrow and regret than you have known to-day.\"', '\"I will try, Marmee; I truly will.', 'But you must help me, remind me, and\\nkeep me from flying out.', 'I used to see father sometimes put his finger\\non his lips, and look at you with a very kind, but sober face, and you\\nalways folded your lips tight or went away: was he reminding you then?\"', 'asked Jo softly.', '\"Yes; I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me\\nfrom many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.\"', 'Jo saw that her Marmee\\'s eyes filled and her lips trembled, as she\\nspoke; and, fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously,\\n\"Was it wrong to watch you, and to speak of it?', 'I didn\\'t mean to be\\nrude, but it\\'s so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so\\nsafe and happy here.\"', '\"My Jo, you may say anything to your Marmee, for it is my greatest\\nhappiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me, and know how\\nmuch I love them.\"', '\"I thought I\\'d grieved you.\"', '\"No, dear; but speaking of father reminded me how much I miss him, how\\nmuch I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his\\nlittle daughters safe and good for him.\"', '\"Yet you told him to go, Marmee, and didn\\'t cry when he went, and never\\ncomplain now, or seem as if you needed any help,\" said Jo, wondering.', '\"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was\\ngone.', 'Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty and\\nwill surely be the happier for it in the end?', \"If I don't seem to need\\nhelp, it is because I have a better friend, even than father, to comfort\\nand sustain me.\", 'My child, the troubles and temptations of your life are\\nbeginning, and may be many; but you can overcome and outlive them all if\\nyou learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as\\nyou do that of your earthly one.', 'The more you love and trust Him, the\\nnearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power\\nand wisdom.', 'His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken\\nfrom you, but may become the source of life-long peace, happiness, and\\nstrength.', 'Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little\\ncares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as\\nyou come to your Marmee.\"', \"Jo's only answer was to hold her Marmee close, and, in the silence which\\nfollowed, the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart\\nwithout words; for in that sad, yet happy hour, she had learned not only\\nthe bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of self-denial\\nand self-control; and, led by her Marmee's hand, she had drawn nearer to\\nthe Friend who welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of\\nany father, tenderer than that of any Marmee.\", 'Amy stirred, and sighed in her sleep; and, as if eager to begin at once\\nto mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it\\nhad never worn before.', '\"I let the sun go down on my anger; I wouldn\\'t forgive her, and to-day,\\nif it hadn\\'t been for Laurie, it might have been too late!', 'How could I\\nbe so wicked?\"', 'said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister,\\nsoftly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.', \"As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a\\nsmile that went straight to Jo's heart.\", 'Neither said a word, but they\\nhugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was\\nforgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.', '[Illustration: Packing the go abroady trunk]\\n\\n                                  IX.', 'MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR.', '\"I do think it

her\\nsisters.', '\"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise.', 'A whole\\nfortnight of fun will be regularly splendid,\" replied Jo, looking like a\\nwindmill, as she folded skirts with her long arms.', '\"And such lovely weather; I\\'m so glad of that,\" added Beth, tidily\\nsorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great\\noccasion.', '\"I wish I was going to have a fine time, and wear all these nice\\nthings,\" said Amy, with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically\\nreplenished her sister\\'s cushion.', '\"I wish you were all going; but, as you can\\'t, I shall keep my\\nadventures to tell you when I come back.', 'I\\'m sure it\\'s the least I can\\ndo, when you have been so kind, lending me things, and helping me get\\nready,\" said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit,\\nwhich seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.', '\"What did Marmee give you out of the treasure-box?\"', 'asked Amy, who had\\nnot been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest, in which Mrs.\\nMarch kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when\\nthe proper time came.', '\"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue\\nsash.', 'I wanted the violet silk; but there isn\\'t time to make it over, so\\nI must be contented with my old tarlatan.\"', '\"It will look nicely over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it\\noff beautifully.', 'I wish I hadn\\'t smashed my coral bracelet, for you\\nmight have had it,\" said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose\\npossessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.', '\"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure-box; but\\nMarmee said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl,\\nand Laurie promised to send me all I want,\" replied Meg.', '\"Now, let me\\nsee; there\\'s my new gray walking-suit--just curl up the feather in my\\nhat, Beth,--then my poplin, for Sunday, and the small party,--it

well, turned and freshly trimmed, that\\nI feel as if I'd got a new one.\", \"My silk sacque isn't a bit the fashion,\\nand my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's; I didn't like to say\\nanything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella.\", 'I told Marmee\\nblack, with a white handle, but she forgot, and bought a green one, with\\na yellowish handle.', 'It\\'s strong and neat, so I ought not to

two pairs of new gloves\\nare my comfort.', 'You are a dear, to lend me yours, Jo.', 'I feel so rich,\\nand sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for\\ncommon;\" and Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove-box.', '\"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her night-caps; would you put\\nsome on mine?\"', \"she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins,\\nfresh from Hannah's hands.\", '\"No, I wouldn\\'t; for the smart caps won\\'t match the plain gowns, without\\nany trimming on them.', 'Poor folks shouldn\\'t rig,\" said Jo decidedly.', '\"I wonder if I

pressed and mended white\\ntarlatan, which she called her \"ball-dress,\" with an important air.', 'The next day was fine, and Meg departed, in style, for a fortnight of\\nnovelty and pleasure.', 'Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather\\nreluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented\\nthan she went.', 'But she had begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to\\ntake good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after\\na winter of irksome work, that the Marmee yielded, and the daughter went\\nto take her first taste of fashionable life.', 'The

frivolous life\\nthey led, and soon put their guest at her ease.', 'Perhaps Meg felt,\\nwithout understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or\\nintelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal\\nthe ordinary material of which they were made.', 'It certainly was\\nagreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best\\nfrock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself.', 'It suited her\\nexactly; and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of\\nthose about her; to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases,\\ncrimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well\\nas she could.', \"The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things, the more\\nshe envied her, and sighed to be rich.\", 'Home now looked bare and dismal\\nas she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she\\nwas a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves\\nand silk stockings.', 'She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls\\nwere busily employed in \"having a good time.\"', 'They shopped, walked,\\nrode, and called all day; went to theatres and operas, or frolicked at\\nhome in the evening; for Annie had many friends, and knew how to\\nentertain them.', 'Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one\\nwas engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought.', 'Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father; and Mrs.\\nMoffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her\\ndaughter had done.', 'Every one petted her; and \"Daisy,\" as they called\\nher, was in a fair way to have her head turned.', 'When the evening for the \"small party\" came, she found that the poplin\\nwouldn\\'t do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses,\\nand making themselves very fine indeed; so out came the tarlatan,\\nlooking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie\\'s crisp new\\none.', 'Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her\\ncheeks began to burn, for, with all her gentleness, she was very proud.', 'No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and\\nAnnie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white\\narms; but in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her\\nheart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed,\\nchattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.', 'The hard, bitter\\nfeeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of\\nflowers.', 'Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were\\nexclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.', '\"It\\'s for Belle, of course; George always sends her some, but these are\\naltogether ravishing,\" cried Annie, with a great sniff.', '\"They are for Miss March, the man said.', 'And here\\'s a note,\" put in the\\nmaid, holding it to Meg.', '\"What fun!', 'Who are they from?', 'Didn\\'t know you had a lover,\" cried the\\ngirls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.', '\"The note is from Marmee, and the flowers from Laurie,\" said Meg simply,\\nyet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.', '\"Oh, indeed!\"', 'said Annie, with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note\\ninto her pocket, as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false\\npride; for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers\\ncheered her up by their beauty.', 'Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for\\nherself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the\\nbreasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that\\nClara, the elder sister, told her she was \"the sweetest little thing she\\never saw;\" and they looked quite charmed with her small attention.', \"Somehow the kind act finished her despondency; and when all the rest\\nwent to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed\\nface in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair, and\\nfastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so _very_\\nshabby now.\", \"She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her\\nheart's content; every one was very kind, and she had three compliments.\", 'Annie made her sing, and some one said she

some spring in her,\" as he gracefully expressed\\nit.', 'So, altogether, she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit\\nof a conversation, which disturbed her extremely.', 'She was sitting just\\ninside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice,\\nwhen she heard a voice ask, on the other side of the flowery wall,--\\n\\n\"How old is he?\"', '\"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say,\" replied another voice.', '\"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn\\'t it?', 'Sallie\\nsays they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.\"', '\"Mrs M. has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well,\\nearly as it is.', 'The girl evidently doesn\\'t think of it yet,\" said Mrs.\\nMoffat.', '\"She told that fib about her mamma, as if

it,\\nbut could not, and kept repeating to herself, \"Mrs. M. has made her\\nplans,\" \"that fib about her mamma,\" and \"dowdy tarlatan,\" till she was\\nready to cry, and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice.', 'As\\nthat was impossible, she did her best to seem gay; and, being rather\\nexcited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she\\nwas making.', 'She was very glad when it was all over, and she was quiet in\\nher bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached\\nand her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.', 'Those foolish,\\nyet well-meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed\\nthe peace of the old one, in which, till now, she had lived as happily\\nas a child.', \"Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoilt by the silly\\nspeeches she had overheard; her faith in her Marmee was a little shaken\\nby the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others\\nby herself; and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple\\nwardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter, was weakened by the\\nunnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest\\ncalamities under heaven.\", 'Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half\\nresentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not\\nspeaking out frankly, and setting everything right.', 'Everybody dawdled\\nthat morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even\\nto take up their worsted work.', 'Something in the manner of her friends\\nstruck Meg at once; they treated her with more respect, she thought;\\ntook quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with\\neyes that plainly betrayed curiosity.', 'All this surprised and flattered\\nher, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her\\nwriting, and said, with a sentimental air,--\\n\\n\"Daisy, dear, I\\'ve sent an invitation to your friend, Mr_Laurence, for\\nThursday.', 'We should like to know him, and it\\'s only a proper compliment\\nto you.\"', 'Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her

white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen; it got sadly\\ntorn last night,\" said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling\\nvery uncomfortable.', '\"Why don\\'t you send home for another?\"', 'said Sallie, who was not an\\nobserving young lady.', '\"I haven\\'t got any other.\"', 'It cost Meg an effort to say that, but Sallie\\ndid not see it, and exclaimed, in amiable

\"a little beauty\" after touching up, caused her to accept, and\\nforget all her former uncomfortable feelings towards the Moffats.', 'On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid; and,\\nbetween them, they turned Meg into a fine lady.', 'They crimped and curled\\nher hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder,\\ntouched her lips with coralline salve, to make them redder, and Hortense\\nwould have added \"a _soupÃ§on_ of rouge,\" if Meg had not rebelled.', 'They\\nlaced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly\\nbreathe, and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in\\nthe mirror.', 'A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace,\\nbrooch, and even ear-rings, for Hortense tied them on, with a bit of\\npink silk, which did not show.', 'A cluster of tea-rosebuds at the bosom,\\nand a _ruche_, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty white\\nshoulders, and a pair of high-heeled blue silk boots satisfied the last\\nwish of her heart.', 'A laced handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a\\nsilver holder finished her off; and Miss Belle surveyed her with the\\nsatisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.', '\"Mademoiselle is charmante, trÃ¨s jolie, is she not?\"', 'cried Hortense,\\nclasping her hands in an affected rapture.', '\"Come and show yourself,\" said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room\\nwhere the others were waiting.', 'As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her ear-rings\\ntinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her\\n\"fun\" had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that\\nshe _was_ \"a little beauty.\"', 'Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase\\nenthusiastically; and, for several minutes, she stood, like the jackdaw\\nin the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered\\nlike a party of magpies.', '\"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of

a goose to wear it.\"', '\"Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,\" said Laurie,\\nlooking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.', 'Away they went, fleetly and

'\"Here comes Ned Moffat; what does he want?\"', 'said Laurie, knitting his\\nblack brows, as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a\\npleasant addition to the party.', '\"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he\\'s coming for\\nthem.', 'What a bore!\"', 'said Meg, assuming a languid air, which amused\\nLaurie immensely.', 'He did not speak to her again till supper-time, when he saw her drinking\\nchampagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving \"like a pair\\nof fools,\" as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort of\\nright to watch over the Marches, and fight their battles whenever a\\ndefender was needed.', '[Illustration: I wouldn\\'t, Meg]\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have a splitting headache to-morrow, if you drink much of that.',

'But he got no\\nchance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say\\ngood-night.', '\"Remember!\"', 'she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had\\nalready begun.',

I can\\'t ask it of you at your age,\" began\\nLaurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to go\\nalone, if he went at all.', 'The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to\\nprevent it; for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that\\nit would not be wise to leave him to his own devices.', 'So, stifling a\\nnatural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind\\nhim, he said stoutly,--\\n\\n\"Bless your soul, I\\'m not superannuated yet.', 'I quite enjoy the idea; it\\nwill do me good, and my old bones won\\'t suffer, for travelling nowadays\\nis almost as easy as sitting in a chair.\"', 'A restless movement from Laurie suggested that _his_ chair was not easy,\\nor that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily,--\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean to be a marplot or a burden; I go because I think you\\'d\\nfeel happier than if I was left behind.', \"I don't intend to gad about with\\nyou, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in my\\nown way.\", 'I\\'ve friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit\\nthem;

lost his appetite, neglected his dress,\\nand devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano; avoided Jo,\\nbut consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragical\\nface that haunted her dreams by night, and oppressed her with a heavy\\nsense of guilt by day.', 'Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of his\\nunrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to\\nattempt consolation or offer sympathy.', 'On some accounts, this was a\\nrelief to his friends; but the weeks before his departure were very\\nuncomfortable, and every one rejoiced that the \"poor, dear fellow was\\ngoing away to forget his trouble, and come home happy.\"', 'Of course, he\\nsmiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by, with the sad\\nsuperiority of one who knew that his fidelity, like his love, was\\nunalterable.', 'When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain\\ninconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves.', 'This\\ngayety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did,\\nfor his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with\\na whisper full of Marmeely solicitude;

and, as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would\\nonly recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in\\nthe most unsentimental aspects,--beating mats with her head tied up in\\na bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa-pillow, or throwing cold\\nwater over his passion _Ã  la_ Gummidge,--and an irresistible laugh\\nspoilt the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint.\", 'Jo wouldn\\'t be\\nput into the Opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a \"Bless\\nthat girl, what a torment she is!\"', 'and a clutch at his hair, as became a\\ndistracted composer.', 'When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to\\nimmortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging\\nreadiness.', \"This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden hair,\\nwas enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before his\\nmind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies, and\\nblue ribbons.\", 'He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but he\\ntook her for his heroine, and grew quite fond of her, as well he might;\\nfor he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted\\nher, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated any mortal\\nwoman.', 'Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but\\ngradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he\\nsat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get new ideas\\nand refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state\\nthat winter.', 'He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and was\\nconscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself.', '\"It\\'s\\ngenius simmering, perhaps.', 'I\\'ll let it simmer, and see what comes of\\nit,\" he said, with a secret suspicion, all the while, that it wasn\\'t\\ngenius, but something far more common.', 'Whatever it was, it simmered to\\nsome purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory\\nlife, began to long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and\\nbody, and finally came to the wise conclusion that every one who loved\\nmusic was not a composer.', 'Returning from one of Mozart\\'s grand operas,\\nsplendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own,\\nplayed a few of the best parts, sat staring up at the busts of\\nMendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again; then\\nsuddenly he tore up his music-sheets, one by one, and, as the last\\nfluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself,--\\n\\n\"She is right!', \"Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so.\", \"That\\nmusic has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I\\nwon't be a humbug any longer.\", 'Now what shall I do?\"', 'That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had\\nto work for his daily bread.', 'Now, if ever, occurred an eligible\\nopportunity for \"going to the devil,\" as he once forcibly expressed it,\\nfor he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially\\nfond of providing employment for full and idle hands.', 'The poor fellow\\nhad temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood\\nthem pretty well; for, much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith\\nand confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire\\nto be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him,\\nand say \"All\\'s well,\" kept him safe and steady.', 'Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, \"I don\\'t believe it;

and when he couldn\\'t have one sister he took\\nthe other, and was happy.\"', 'Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them; and the next\\ninstant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself,--\\n\\n\"No, I won\\'t!', \"I haven't forgotten, I never can.\", 'I\\'ll try again, and if\\nthat fails, why, then--\"\\n\\nLeaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to\\nJo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the\\nleast hope of her changing her mind.', \"Couldn't she, wouldn't she, and let\\nhim come home and be happy?\", 'While waiting for an answer he did nothing,\\nbut he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience.', \"It\\ncame at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for Jo\\ndecidedly couldn't and wouldn't.\", 'She was wrapped up in Beth, and never\\nwished to hear the word \"love\" again.', 'Then she begged him to be happy\\nwith somebody else, but always to keep a little corner of his heart for\\nhis loving sister Jo.', 'In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy\\nthat Beth was worse; she was coming home in the spring, and there was no\\nneed of saddening the remainder of her stay.', 'That would be time enough,\\nplease God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her feel\\nlonely, homesick, or anxious.', '\"So I will, at once.', 'Poor little girl; it will be a sad going home for\\nher, I\\'m afraid;\" and Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had\\nbeen the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks\\nbefore.', 'But he did not write the letter that day; for, as he rummaged out his\\nbest paper, he came across something which changed his purpose.', \"Tumbling\\nabout in one part of the desk, among bills, passports, and business\\ndocuments of various kinds, were several of Jo's letters, and in another\\ncompartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her\\nblue ribbons, and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away\\ninside.\", \"With a half-repentant, half-amused expression, Laurie gathered\\nup all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small\\ndrawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his\\nfinger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the\\ndrawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling as if\\nthere had been a funeral;

and, when\\nMrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while Teddy\\nwiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to sing.', 'Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and from tree\\nto tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys sung, with all\\ntheir hearts, the little song Jo had written, Laurie set to music, and\\nthe Professor trained his lads to give with the best effect.', \"This was\\nsomething altogether new, and it proved a grand success; for Mrs. March\\ncouldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands with every\\none of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and Emil to the little\\nquadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.\", 'After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and\\nher daughters under the festival tree.', '[Illustration: \"Leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival\\n                           tree.\"', '--Page 583]\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think I ever ought to call myself \\'Unlucky Jo\\' again, when my\\ngreatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,\" said Mrs. Bhaer,\\ntaking Teddy\\'s little fist out of the milk-pitcher, in which he was\\nrapturously churning.', '\"And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long\\nago.', 'Do you remember our castles in the air?\"', 'asked Amy, smiling as she\\nwatched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.', '\"Dear fellows!', 'It does my heart good to see them forget business, and\\nfrolic for a day,\" answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all\\nmankind.', '\"Yes, I remember;
